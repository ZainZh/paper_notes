1. The integration of spectroscopic data presents a promising **new sensing modality** for soft robots to understand the
   material composition of grasped items, facilitating numerous applications for foodprocessing and manufacturing.
2. Our goal in this research is to demonstrate visible to near infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy in tandem with manipulation
   by a soft gripper, as a step towards improved in-hand object recognition.
3. This knowledge is useful in not only discriminating between classes, but also in understanding intra-class variation.
4. Field spectroscopy is a developing discipline, particularly within the area of robotics.
5. Our work contributes a unique capability to recognize objects beyond shape, weight, and texture.
